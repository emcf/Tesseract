A low-level 3D model viewer with some overly complex projection and transformation formulas.

# How to create models

To create a model, simply create a .xyz file and write the co-ordinates of each vertex in the file followed by a newline for each new vertex.

```
-1,1,-1
1,1,-1
-1,-1,-1
1,-1,-1
-1,1,1
1,1,1
-1,-1,1
1,-1,1
```
